        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h5>1) Get the Hardware</h5>
        <p>Subnodes runs off a <a href="http://www.newark.com/raspberry-pi/raspbrry-modb-512m/model-b-assembled-board-only/dp/43W5302" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Model B</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNE6/" target="_blank">8GB class 10 SD card</a>, 2-3x<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BWFXYS/" target="_blank">wireless adapater</a> running the rt5370 chipset, and optional <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJA75Y0/" target="_blank">battery</a>, if you need to get mobile with your device. The additional <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BWFXYS/" target="_blank">wireless adapters</a> can be used for running the mesh point and connecting the Raspberry Pi to the greater internet if data needs to be uploaded or custom apps installed.</p>

        <h5>2) Download Subnodes</h5>
        <p>The preconfigured disk-image is not yet available, so you'll have to clone <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/tree/dev-dashboard">the subnodes repository</a> and run install_subnodes.sh through your Raspberry Pi</p>

        <h5>3) That's it!</h5>
        <p>With your Subnodes configured Raspberry Pi, just plug it in anywhere. You'll notice a subnodes wifi appear which when you log into, will let you reconfigure your Raspberry Pi's network settings or application.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>The Subnodes project is an open source initiative focused on streamlining the process of setting up a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> as a wireless access point for distributing content, media, and shared digital experiences. The device behaves as a web server, creates its own local area network, and does not connect with the Internet. This is key for the sake of offering a space where people can communicate anonymously and freely, as well as maximizing the portability of the networkâ€“no dependability on an internet connection means the device can be taken and remain active anywhere. The devices are also mesh enabled, implementing the <a href="http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki" target="_blank">BATMAN Advanced</a> routing protocol.
        </p>

        <p>Subnodes networking is set up using linux software packages <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/hostapd" target="_blank">hostapd</a> and <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html" target="_blank">dnsmasq</a>. The latest version of Raspbian comes with the latest BATMAN advanced module installed, so mesh-enabling your device is as simple as turning the module on and running a few commands.</p>

        <p>Initial support for Subnodes has been provided by <a href="http://eyebeam.org/" target="_blank">Eyebeam</a>. Source code for the initiating project can be found over on  <a href="https://github.com/chootka/subnodes" target="_blank">github</a>, which includes an installation script and detailed installation instructions. The version you're seeing added a GUI for headless and easy network reconfiguration and to allow apps to be installed and configured. This version can also be found on <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/tree/dev-dashboard" target="_blank">github</a>.
